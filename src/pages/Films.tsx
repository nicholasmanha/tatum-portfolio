        <p className="text-lg">
          I earned my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Emerson College in
          Boston, MA. I specialized my coursework in sound design, writing,
          directing and producing. While at Emerson, I worked through a variety
          of student organizations including Emerson Independent Video, The
          Emerson Channel, Frames Per Second and National Broadcast Society.
          Additionally, I worked on multiple independent projects including BFA
          and BA capstone projects. I was given the Student Award of Distinction
          at the 2024 EVVY Awards.
